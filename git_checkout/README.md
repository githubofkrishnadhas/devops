This is a folder which can be referenced to do the simple Git checkouts to a repo.

For checkout we can use HTTPS or SSH address of repository.

If we are using HTTPS address for git url : you need to use github access token as credentialId to authenticate with it 
(github is not supporting username/password authentication now )

If we are using SSH address : we can use ssh pvt key method as credentialId.  we have to add the public key to repo before it.

under branch : we can specify which branch we need to checkout to
